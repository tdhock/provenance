** Egg sizes

| size (fr)  | size (en) | Crepuscule (g) | Canada (g) | USA (oz) |
|------------+-----------+----------------+------------+----------|
| jumbo      | Jumbo     |            >69 | >=70       |     >2.5 |
| extra gros | XL        |                | >=63       |    >2.25 |
| gros       | L         |          56-63 | >=56       |       >2 |
| moyen      | M         |          49-55 | >=49       |    >1.75 |
| petit      | S         |          42-49 | >=42       |     >1.5 |
|            | Peewee    |                | <42        |    >1.25 |

Weight (g) comes from the Crepuscule web page. Extra gros has a
question mark (?) since it was not listed on the web page. From
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_egg_sizes][wikipedia:Chicken_egg_sizes]] I see that the grades are defined by the
USDA, in oz. Also Canada defines egg sizes [[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._284/page-17.html][on this web page]].
