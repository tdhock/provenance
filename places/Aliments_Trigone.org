- 16 Nov 2015, tdhock: Called Aliments Trigone (877) 259-7491. Talked
  to Cathy LEMONDE about where their hemp seeds come from. She said
  they come from either the Canadian West, or from Quebec. When I
  asked her if she could tell me the names of the farms that she buys
  from, she told me that information is "confidential." She told me I
  could call back and ask her boss Jacques. 93, chemin de l'Aqueduc,
  Saint-François-de-la-Rivière-du-Sud, AC Canada, G0R-3A0. (418)
