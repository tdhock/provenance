Olive oil?

*** 16 Nov 2016

Called Aliments Trigone (877) 259-7491. Talked to Cathy LEMONDE about
where their hemp seeds come from. She said they come from either the
Canadian West, or from Quebec. When I asked her if she could tell me
the names of the farms that she buys from, she told me that
information is "confidential." She told me I could call back and ask
her boss Jacques.

Called Ferme Michaca (450) 264-4369 but nobody picked up. Their
package says 7.55$/250g.

Called Aliments Merci (514) 955-7295 and I left a message on an
answering machine. Waiting for a call back.

Lufa's [[https://montreal.lufa.com/en/superMarket/product/slug/3603-graines-de-chanvre-bios/id/3603][hemp seeds web page]] says that sell them for 4$/100g and they
come from Yupik. Their [[http://www.yupik.ca/products/10019-ORGANIC-HULLED-HEMP-SEEDS/][hemp seeds web page]] says they sell them for
16.79$/lb. TODO call them and ask where they get them +1-514-787-1600,
1-855-449-8745.
